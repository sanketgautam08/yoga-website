            <p>
              One morning, I listened to my intuition and felt the call to
              Indonesia, to go to Bali. In reality, I'm at the bottom of the
              hole, the hole of suffering. I still can't get out of this hole. I
              pretend not to see it, I fall into it, sometimes I come out of it,
              but I still go back into it far too often. Yet sometimes I see it,
              and I often fall in out of habit, even with my eyes open. My eyes
              are open because I've been working on this suffering for many
              years now. But the suffering is deep, it's not my fault, the road
              is long. That's surely why the right moment had arrived. To face
              my inner self head-on. To face this suffering with open eyes. The
              truth of suffering, declared Buddha, must be explored to its
              conclusion.So it was with open eyes that I set off for the first
              time to the other side of the world, to Indonesia, for a spiritual
              retreat. Having been initiated into the philosophy of yoga for
              years, the island of the gods is calling me.I want to go on a
              spiritual retreat in Bali. And why not learn more about yoga. So I
              decided to kill two birds with one stone and enrolled in a school
              in BALI for 1 month, where I did my 200H YTT. I'm immersed in
              Balinese culture, I'm living a most magical experience. Bali
              touches my heart. I come away from this experience enriched,
              nourished and changed. In Bali, I practice regularly in renowned
              studios, enriching my physical practice on a daily basis.I train
              and learn with teachers from all over the world. Down there, I
              find a great community of yogis.The energy is powerful.I find it
              very hard to leave this island, my first refuge. Above all, it's a
              profound personal experience that I've just had, and the pride of
              having obtained my 200H yoga teacher's diploma at the same time. I
              spent several months in Bali, immersing myself in Hinduism and
              Balinese culture, and then left for Thailand, where I learned
              about Buddhism and Thai culture.

                It was an intense first experience. I returned to France. I
                teach. I discover the joy of teaching, of sharing knowledge. I
                know what I want to share. But I feel I need to learn more from
                myself. I'm at the beginning of my path. I can feel it. This
                time I walk around the hole. I observe it. It's my
                responsibility. But to observe it is still to see it.Beyond not
                wanting to go in, I don't want to go near it. The revelation. I
                have to go back. I have to dig . I must experiment. I crave
                nourishment. I remember Buddha's words. I must continue to
                explore, my traumas, my anxieties, my fears to their end.

                I'm back in Bali, where I'm spending 2 months. This time in
                depth. I experience yoga in all its branches. These 8 branches.
                I deepen my personal practice, my profound knowledge of myself.
                I put PRANAYAMA and breathwork into practice, and feel the
                benefits in terms of stress and emotional management. Then I go
                to India for the first time. I intensify my personal physical
                practice by learning Ashtanga yoga with qualified teachers.
                Afterwards, I spent a month in a school where I took a further
                300H of yoga teacher training. This time, I was introduced to
                various meditation practices. It was the first time I'd ever
                been in this field, and it was the beginning of a profound
                metamorphosis.

              restful place.I meet Swami Shashwat Ji.I started meditating with
              this Guru, 2 hours of silent meditation from 4pm to 6pm every
              day.At first, I wasn't regular, but then I became disciplined and
              went every day for a month.I find my place. I can feel the power
              of the meditation. Swami Shashwat Ji lends me his book on
              self-realization, Living in Mindfulness.I feel lucky to have the
              only French version in my hands.I'm learning a lot.I'm fascinated
              by his enlightenment.I understand mindfulness.But I need to learn
              a real technique, I need to go deep into self-realization.

              I'm learning KRYA YOGA with the Lahiri Mahashay family. Kriya Yoga
              is a technique based on concentration and energy. Shibendu Lahiri,
              great-grandson of Lahiri Mahasahya, father of Kriya Yoga. he
              shares the original teaching technique of Kriya Yoga with all
              those who sincerely wish to learn it. The secret and sacred
              techniques of Kriya Yoga are passed down unchanged from father to
              son in the dynastic lineage. I spend 5 days in this ashram, in the
              heart of Varanasi. Grateful, once again, I am nourished from
              within.

              My healing through the vibratory power of SOUND. Having touched on
              various meditation methods, this time I found another healing
              power in the vibratory power of SOUND. Sound is a powerful force
              that affects mind, body and soul. On my first trips to India, I
              discovered the Kirtans, the music and the songs. I found in them a
              therapeutic power. Then, on a second trip to Nepal, I plunged
              deeper into this experience of sound healing thanks to the Tibetan
              bowls. This time I digested in a mountain village at the foot of
              the Annapurnas for a 5-day introduction to sound healing bowls.
            </p>
            <p>
              I rejuvenate in nature with the Tibetan bowls. There, I learn in
              the most traditional way how to use these precious bowls and
              understand their effectiveness. I spend 5 days on this farm,
              living with this family in the most authentic way. It gave me an
              instant calm that took meditation to another level. Nepal was one
              of the most powerful and transformative experiences of my life. I
              felt the culmination of what I had come to explore. Sometimes
              something magical happens when you travel: you remember exactly
              why you're doing it, and you're so happy and present in that
              moment. Sometimes it's the people you meet, sometimes it's the
              places you find yourself. Sometimes it's both. My suffering led me
              to Indonesia, so in the end it's thanks to my suffering that I've
              come this far. Today, having learned observation and compassion, I
              thank my suffering, i want to thank myself. Learning to embrace
              discomfort. Transition is uncomfortable and scary, but it leads
              you to fulfillment.

              As you can imagine, travel is part of my life, and when I talk
              about yoga, I often mean a journey towards oneself. I've been on
              this journey for several years now, and I'm on it every day. As
              you can see, yoga isn't just a physical practice, it's much more
              than that. It's a philosophy of life, a way of living. Yoga has
              literally changed my life and continues to do it every day. It
              makes me free from my fears, my blockages and my suffering. It's
              the way of life I've chosen, the one that nourishes me, my
              balance, my refuge. Determined to share the transformative
              benefits of yoga with the world, I teach online and around the
              world. I teach traditional Hatha Yoga, which is my foundation, my
              first refuge. Meditation and pranayamas accompany all my classes,
              as do my precious Tibetan bowls. In reality, I have no particular
              style of yoga. I follow my daily flow, but above all the flow of
              my students. It's a moment between you and me, one-to-one or in a
              group, souls on a different path but who, once on the mat, are
              looking for the same thing: to get closer to the inner reality of
              their existence. My aim is for everyone to find their own path to
              inner peace through the various courses and practices on offer.
              It's thanks to my personal experience, my spiritual journey, my
              journey towards being, and my theoretical training, that I'm able
              to pass on my knowledge. Isn't it wonderful to be able to help?
              And if being helped makes you want to help in turn, wouldn't that
              be magical too? Why keep something positive within us to pass on?
              Yoga is a way of life. Yoga is a journey towards self-realization,
              yoga is a transmission. Teaching yoga in a theoretical way, but
              passing it on in a spiritual way. Since life is constantly
              changing, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow, but today I'm here
              and now.
