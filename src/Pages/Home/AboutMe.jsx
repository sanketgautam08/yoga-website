            I'm Kora, from Marseille in the south of France. I'm a yoga teacher,
            certified yoga alliance 500h, trained in India, Indonesia, Nepal and
            France.

            In search of adventure and discovery at a painful time in my life, I
            flew to the other side of the world. These months of travel have
            been transformative. I have deepened my personal practice and
            knowledge of yoga, much further than asanas. This is how I knew that
            yoga was much more than a passion, but a lifestyle and then, my
            vocation. After more than 5 years of personal practice, I decided to
            train in Bali, Indonesia. I had the opportunity to be trained by
            local teachers who made this training so enriching professionally,
            as well as personally. When I returned to France, I taught for a
            yoga center and associations. Then, I quickly continued on my path,
            across the world. An eternal student, I continued to learn by
            following training in India and Nepal where I found my refuge, my
            safe place.

            Today, I am a nomadic yoga teacher. I teach in different countries
            and give online courses. I am committed to authentically
            transmitting my experience and knowledge and to supporting you in
            the discovery of this transformative practice.

            My practice and teaching are deep and varied. For example: breathing
            techniques, meditation, satsang and asana practice. I teach with the
            flow of the day, of the present moment accompanied by my Tibetan
            bowls. Yoga is not just about physical practices, it is not only
            practiced on the mat but in all aspects of life. But what is
            physical and what's not is, for question. No matter what one does,
            isn't it all physical?
