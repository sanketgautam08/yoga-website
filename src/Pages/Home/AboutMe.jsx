          But that's not all. After completing my first year of a BTS in dietetics, and following a career change in 2019, I became a full health nutrition coach certified by Dr Yann Rougier. At the same time, I'm also a Renata Franca lymphatic drainage massage practitioner.

          As you'll have gathered by now, I've always had a particular interest in wellbeing and health, but not just any health: FULL health.
          What we call full health is a balanced lifestyle made up of 5 factors: nutrition, emotions, stress, sleep and physical activity.                          
          An imbalance in one or more of these factors can lead to health problems in the short or long term.
