                The aim of food rebalancing is first and foremost to improve
                your lifestyle and learn how to eat healthily... so it applies
                to everyone, whether you&#39;re trying to lose weight or not.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Rebalancing your diet means learning to balance your plate and
                implementing these changes over time, so that you know which
                food categories and quantities your body needs for good health,
                and learn to listen to your body.

              <br />
              <p>
                Our aim? To help you develop healthy eating habits to avoid
                deficiencies, excess weight and illness.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                My consultations are based on respect, listening to your needs
                and sharing.

                Food rebalancing is not a slimming diet, it&#39;s a way of life,
                a daily way of eating healthily to provide your body with the
                energy it needs to meet its vital requirements. Let&#39;s not
                forget that food is our fuel, our ally!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>Health food before slimming food.</p>

              <p>
                First, I give you a questionnaire so that I can get to know you,
                your lifestyle and your eating habits. I ask you to write down
                all your meals in your food diary over 3 consecutive days + 1
                weekend day, so that I can analyze your habits.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                This questionnaire and the food diary are invaluable tools for
                preparing a customized rebalancing program tailored to YOUR
                needs.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We&#39;ll then have our first telephone appointment. This will
                enable us to introduce ourselves and discuss your questionnaire
                feedback in greater detail, so that we can offer you a
                customized program based on your objectives.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We don&#39;t have the same background, the same knowledge, the
                same habits, the same lifestyle or the same constraints.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>You&#39;re unique, and so should your treatment.</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If you&#39;re aiming to lose weight, I&#39;ll guide you in that
                direction, but never at the expense of balance and health.
              </p>

                We&#39;ll then have our first telephone appointment. This will
                enable us to introduce ourselves and discuss your questionnaire

                We don&#39;t have the same background, the same knowledge, the

              <br />
              <p>
                To maintain stable health, it&#39;s recommended that you lose no
                more than 500g/week. In other words, it&#39;s not healthy to
                lose 5 kilos in 2 weeks, or 10 kilos in 8 weeks.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                That&#39;s why my programs last a minimum of 3 months. So as not
                to shock the body into a sudden and unhealthy change.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                What&#39;s more, I&#39;m here to help you get back to full
                health, and that doesn&#39;t just mean diet. Health is a life
                balance, and there are several factors to take into account in
                this balance in addition to nutrition: emotions, stress, sleep
                and physical activity.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If one factor is not stable, weight loss can be blocked. Full
                health is the balance of these 5 factors, what we call the 5
                factors of life. Together, we&#39;ll assess these different
                factors and put in place daily ways of balancing them, so that
                you become a player in your own health.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                It&#39;s not difficult to find full health, but it&#39;s
                essential to be accompanied because your health is precious.
                Following our first telephone consultation, I&#39;ll draw up a
                complete and personal nutritional assessment and send it to you
                by e-mail. So let&#39;s start this adventure together
